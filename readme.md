# Charleston project
Personal project on charleston dance. Back-end in Node / Express and front-end in React.

## First step : launch back-end
!! To successfully launch back end you need to have a Node version prior to 10. Otherwise the sqlite database won't work !!
- open a terminal and go to the back folder
- yarn
- node bin/www
- back end will open in http://localhost:3000/

## Second step : launch front end :
-open a new terminal and go to the front folder
- yarn
- yarn start
- react front end will open on another localhost port.
